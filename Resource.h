Resource module
DESCRIPTION
This data module defines the resources in the simulation system, including costing
information and resource availability. Resources may have a fixed capacity that does
not vary over the simulation run or may operate based on a schedule. Resource
failures and states can also be specified in this module.
TYPICAL USES
 Equipment (machinery, cash register, phone line)
 People (clerical, order processing, sales clerks, operators)
PROMPTS
Prompt Description
Name The name of the resource whose characteristics are being
defined. This name must be unique.
Type Method for determining the capacity for a resource. Fixed
Capacity will not change during the simulation run. Based on
Schedule signifies that a Schedule module is used to specify the
capacity and duration information for the resource.
Capacity Number of resource units of a given name that are available to
the system for processing. Applies only when Type is Fixed
Capacity.
Schedule Name Identifies the name of the schedule to be used by the resource.
The schedule defines the capacity of a resource for a given
period of time. Applies only when type is Schedule.
Schedule Rule Dictates when the actual capacity change is to occur when a
decrease in capacity is required for a busy resource unit. Applies
only when Type is Schedule.
Busy/Hour Cost per hour of a resource that is processing an entity. The
resource becomes busy when it is originally allocated to an entity
and becomes idle when it is released. During the time when it is
busy, cost will accumulate based on the busy/hour cost. The busy
cost per hour is automatically converted to the appropriate base
time unit specified within the Replication Parameters page of the
Run > Setup menu item.
Idle/Hour Cost per hour of a resource that is idle. The resource is idle while
it is not processing an entity. During the time when it is idle, cost
will accumulate based on the idle/hour cost. The idle cost per
hour is automatically converted to the appropriate base time unit
specified within the Replication Parameters page of the Run >
Setup menu item.
Per Use Cost of a resource on a usage basis, regardless of the time for
which it is used. Each time the resource is allocated to an entity,
it will incur a per-use cost.
StateSet Name Name of states that the resource may be assigned during the
simulation run.
Initial State Initial state of a resource. If specified, the name must be defined
within the repeat group of state names. This field is shown only
when a StateSet Name is defined.
Failures Lists all failures that will be associated with the resource.
 Failure Name–Name of the failure associated with the
resource.
 Failure Rule–Behavior that should occur when a failure is to
occur for a busy resource unit.
Report Statistics Specifies whether or not statistics will be collected automatically
and stored in the report database for this resource.
