Variable module
DESCRIPTION
This data module is used to define a variable’s dimension and values. You can
reference variables in other modules (for example, the Decide module), reassign new
values to variables with the Assign module, and use variables in any expression.
You can use an external data file to specify variable values, and you can specify the
variable’s initial values in the Variable module. If you use both methods, the values
are read at different times, depending on the options you specify, including the File
Read Time, the Clear Option, and the replication parameters you specify in the Run
Setup dialog box. For more information, see the online Help.
There are three methods for manually editing the Initial Values of a Variable module:
 Using the standard spreadsheet interface. In the module spreadsheet, right-click
on the Initial Values cell and select the Edit via spreadsheet menu item. The
values for two-dimensional arrays should be entered one column at a time. Array
elements not explicitly assigned are assumed to have the last entered value.
 Using the module dialog box. In the module spreadsheet, right-click on any cell
and select the Edit via dialog menu item. The values for two-dimensional arrays
should be entered one column at a time. Array elements not explicitly assigned
are assumed to have the last entered value.
 Using the two-dimensional (2-D) spreadsheet interface. In the module
spreadsheet, click on the Initial Values cell.
TYPICAL USES
 Number of documents processed per hour
 Serial number to assign to parts for unique identification
 Space available in a facility
PROMPTS
Prompt Description
Name The unique name of the variable being defined.
Rows Number of rows in a one- or two-dimensional variable.
Columns Number of columns in a two-dimensional variable.
Report Statistics Check box for determining whether or not statistics will be
collected. This field is visible when the rows and columns are
not specified (that is, for single variables).
Data Type The data type of the values stored in the variable. Valid types are
Real and String. The default type is Real.
Clear Option Defines the time (if at all) when the value(s) of the variable is
reset to the initial value(s) specified. Specifying Statistics resets
this variable to its initial value(s) whenever statistics are cleared.
Specifying System resets this variable to its initial value(s)
whenever the system is cleared. Specifying None indicates that
this variable is never reset to its initial value(s), except prior to
the first replication.
File Name Name of the file from which to read the variable's value or
values. You can use any file access type supported by Arena
except sequential text files and Lotus spreadsheet (.wks) files. If
the file name you specify has not been created yet, Arena will
create it, but you must edit the file to specify the file access type,
path, and recordset (if required).
Recordset Name of the recordset in the specified file from which to read
values. This field is available only if you specify a File Name for
a file that has been set up with a file access type, path, and
recordset. Arena uses the Rows and Columns properties to
determine the amount of data to read from the recordset. A
recordset is required for all file types except .xml. The recordset
size must be equal to or greater than the number of rows and
columns specified for the variable.
File Read Time Specifies when to read the values from the file into the variable.
If you select PreCheck, the values for the variable are read while
the model is still in Edit mode (prior to the model being checked
and compiled). If you select BeginSimulation, values are read
when the model is compiled, prior to the first replication. If you
select BeginReplication, values are read prior to each
replication.
Initial Values Lists the initial value or values of the variable. You can assign
new values to the variable at different stages of the model by
using the Assign module.
Initial Value Variable value at the start of the simulation.
