 PickStation module
DESCRIPTION
The PickStation module allows an entity to select a particular station from the
multiple stations specified. This module picks among the group of stations based on
the selection logic defined with the module. The entity may then route, transport,
convey, or connect to the station specified. If the method chosen is connect, the
selected station is assigned to an entity attribute. The station selection process is
based on the minimum or maximum value of a variety of system variables and
expressions.
TYPICAL USES
 A part sent to a processing station based on machine’s availability at each station
 A loan application sent to a set of loan officers based on the number sent to each
officer
 A customer selecting among cashier lines based on the least number waiting in
each line
