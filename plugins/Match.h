Match module
DESCRIPTION
The Match module brings together a specified number of entities waiting in different
queues. The match may be accomplished when there is at least one entity in each of
the desired queues. Additionally, an attribute may be specified such that the entities
waiting in the queues must have the same attribute values before the match is
initiated.
When an entity arrives at the Match module, it is placed in one of up to five
associated queues, based on the entry point to which it is connected. Entities will
remain in their respective queues until a match exists.
Once a match exists, one entity from each queue is released to be matched. The
matched entities are then synchronized to depart from the module.
TYPICAL USES
 Assembling a part
 Gathering various products for a customer order
 Synchronizing a customer exit with a filled order
Prompt Description
Name Unique module identifier displayed on the module shape.
Number to Match Number of matching entities that must reside in different queues
before a match may be completed.
Type Method for matching the incoming entities. If Type is Any
Entities, one entity must reside in each queue for a match to be
made. If Type is Based on Attribute, one entity must reside in
each queue with the same attribute value.
Attribute Name Attribute name that is used for identifying an arriving entity’s
match value. Applies only when Type is Based on Attribute.
